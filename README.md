## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project was built during my mentorship program, which is still in progress. It's a web application for tracking orders, and payments for each of them. It implements many technologies that were previously foreign to me, but led to deepening of my understanding about web app structure, optimization stategies, and overall website functionality. You can find all features in [technologies](#built_using) section.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for a ready-to-use site, with which you can play.

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:erratinsilentio/Orders.git
```

2. Move to project directory:

```
cd /Orders
```

3. Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Run application on your local machine:

```

```

Feel free to play with this code by yourself!

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

1. Sign up & Log in
2. Now you can add client with all his details
3. Then you can enter new orders, and choose for which client they belong
4. Each new order comes with a status 'new'
5. On /orders page, you can choose which orders are awaiting payment - and change their status to 'awaiting'
